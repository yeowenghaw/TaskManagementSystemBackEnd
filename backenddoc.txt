cd Desktop/TaskManagementSystem/tmsbackend

node index.js

Node JS is the platform but Express is the framework

packages needed
npm install express
  express is the framework we are using
npm install dotenv
https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv
  loads environment variables from a .env file, so that environment variables are seperate from code

use routes overhere to implement the rest api(?), so frontend will make calls here which will then make calls to the database
